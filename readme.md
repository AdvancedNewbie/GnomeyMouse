GnomeyMouse

A small Qt C++ Windows Application that sits in the tray and monitors your mouse cursor position.  When the X and Y coordinates match up to whatever you set them to be it will run the 'Task View' that shows thumbnails of all the running applications all at once and allows you to switch between different windows / applications quickly.  Task View is quite similar to Gnome 3's application overview.
